This code should be started with a command line, like Git Bash.<br>
You can save this code in a python file (`py`) on your computer.<br>
Then you move to the folder where you stored this file.<br><br>

* see the current directory, in which you are located (print working directory): `pw`
* change the directory (eg from c to d): `cd /d`
